# NFR Validation Results
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "OAuth2 with proper server-side validation, but missing rate limiting and session DB storage. Email validation added during QA review to comply with standards."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Efficient database queries with JOIN and LIMIT. Minor optimization opportunity in JWT callback (duplicate query)."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling, graceful degradation, clear user feedback. All error paths tested."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean code structure, well-documented, follows established patterns. Some type assertions present due to Auth.js limitations (documented)."
