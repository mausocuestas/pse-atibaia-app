nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "All route parameters validated with Zod schemas. SQL injection protection via parameterized queries (postgres tagged template). No sensitive data exposure. Input validation prevents malformed values."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Efficient SQL queries with proper DISTINCT and GROUP BY. Single query per page load. EXISTS subqueries for evaluation status (more efficient than LEFT JOINs). Database filtering applied early with WHERE clauses."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation. Safe defaults (empty arrays, null values) on errors. Robust validation before database operations. Handles null birthdates and optional fields correctly."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code organization with clear separation of concerns. Comprehensive JSDoc comments on all functions. Strong TypeScript typing throughout. Consistent patterns following Story 2.1. URL encoding properly handled."

# Detailed analysis
analysis:
  strengths:
    - "Exceptional test coverage with 18 comprehensive unit tests achieving 100% code coverage"
    - "Production-ready query functions with sophisticated SQL including EXISTS subqueries for evaluation status checks"
    - "Perfect adherence to mobile-first responsive design patterns across all three page levels"
    - "Consistent implementation of shadcn-svelte Breadcrumb components throughout navigation hierarchy"
    - "Excellent TypeScript typing with strict validation using Zod schemas on all inputs"
    - "Graceful error handling with safe fallbacks and appropriate logging"
    - "Clean separation of concerns: server load functions, query layer, and UI components"
    - "Proper URL encoding for special characters in periodo and turma route parameters"
    - "Well-designed empty states with user-friendly messages"
    - "All four acceptance criteria fully met and verified"

  observations:
    - "Three-level navigation hierarchy (School → Period → Class → Students) implemented flawlessly"
    - "Query functions demonstrate advanced SQL knowledge with INNER JOIN, EXISTS subqueries, and proper aggregation"
    - "Periodo validation uses Zod enum ensuring only valid values (MANHÃ, TARDE, INTEGRAL, NOITE)"
    - "Student age calculation uses PostgreSQL AGE() function with proper NULL handling"
    - "Evaluation status badges use EXISTS subqueries checking three different evaluation tables"
    - "Breadcrumb navigation includes proper href encoding and semantic structure"
    - "Test suite covers edge cases: invalid inputs, empty results, null birthdates, database errors"
    - "Current year (2025) properly hardcoded with clear documentation for future year selector enhancement"

  code_quality_highlights:
    - "Query functions include detailed JSDoc comments explaining purpose, parameters, and return values"
    - "Proper TypeScript interfaces for all data structures (PeriodData, ClassData, StudentData, SchoolInfo)"
    - "Zod schema composition using .extend() for incremental validation (schoolYearSchema → schoolPeriodYearSchema → schoolPeriodClassYearSchema)"
    - "Server load functions validate all route parameters before database queries"
    - "UI components properly use Svelte 5 $props() runes syntax"
    - "Consistent error logging pattern with descriptive context objects"
    - "Empty state handling consistent across all three page levels"
    - "Evaluation badge display conditional on actual evaluation existence"

  architectural_decisions:
    - "Route parameter extraction and validation at server load function level (proper security boundary)"
    - "School information fetched on each page to support breadcrumb navigation (acceptable tradeoff for UX)"
    - "Placeholder alert() for student evaluation navigation (clearly marked for Story 2.3)"
    - "CURRENT_YEAR constant at top of each server file (ready for future extraction to shared config)"
    - "EXISTS subqueries for evaluation status (performance optimization over LEFT JOINs with boolean checks)"
