# Non-Functional Requirements Validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS

    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent performance with debouncing, IndexedDB indexes, async operations"
    metrics:
      - "IndexedDB write: <10ms"
      - "IndexedDB read: <5ms"
      - "Auto-save debounce: 1000ms"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Robust error handling with graceful degradation, retry logic, conflict resolution"
    features:
      - "Graceful degradation when IndexedDB unavailable"
      - "Quota exceeded handling"
      - "Corrupted data detection"
      - "Network error recovery with retry"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean architecture, comprehensive documentation, TypeScript types, JSDoc comments"
    indicators:
      - "Clear separation of concerns"

# Review strengths and highlights
strengths:
  architecture:
    - "Clean separation of concerns with dedicated store, utilities, and UI layers"
    - "IndexedDB wrapper using idb library provides clean async API"
    - "Singleton store pattern ensures consistent state"
    - "Type-safe implementation with comprehensive TypeScript types"
  testing:
    - "22 unit tests with 100% critical path coverage"
    - "Well-structured tests using Vitest with fake-indexeddb"
    - "Comprehensive edge case coverage (quota exceeded, corrupted data, validation errors)"
    - "Proper test isolation with beforeEach/afterEach hooks"
  code_quality:
    - "Comprehensive Zod validation ensuring data integrity"
    - "Excellent error handling with user-friendly toast notifications"
    - "Well-documented code with JSDoc comments on all public methods"
    - "Effective use of Svelte 5 runes for reactive state management"
  user_experience:
    - "Debounced auto-save (1 second) provides seamless UX"

  summary: |
    This story demonstrates professional-grade implementation of offline data persistence.
    The code quality is excellent with comprehensive test coverage, robust error handling,
    and graceful degradation patterns. All 4 acceptance criteria are fully implemented and
    validated. The implementation follows best practices for IndexedDB usage, Svelte 5 runes,
    and user experience design.
