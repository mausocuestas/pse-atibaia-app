production_ready: true

qa_summary: |
  Story 3.1 has been thoroughly reviewed and tested. All acceptance criteria are met,
  automated tests pass, and the implementation follows project standards. The dashboard
  successfully displays 3 ECharts visualizations with proper data aggregation from the
  database. Manager role protection is properly implemented. Minor technical debt noted
  but does not block production deployment.

# ==============================================================================
# CODE QUALITY REVIEW
# ==============================================================================

code_quality:
  architecture_compliance: "PASS"
  notes: |
    ✅ Follows project file structure conventions
    ✅ Database queries separated in queries/dashboard.ts
    ✅ Server-side data loading in +page.server.ts
    ✅ Client-side presentation in +page.svelte
    ✅ Reusable EChart component created
    ✅ shadcn-svelte components properly utilized

  typescript_usage: "PASS_WITH_NOTES"
  notes: |
    ✅ All query functions properly typed
    ✅ Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces defined
    ✅ Props properly typed with Svelte 5 $props rune
    ⚠️ Minor: 'as any' type assertion in EChart component (lines 18, 35)
       - Reason: echarts type compatibility with Svelte 5
       - Impact: Low - contained to single component
       - Recommendation: Improve in future iteration

  error_handling: "PASS"
  notes: |
    ✅ All database queries wrapped in try-catch
    ✅ Graceful degradation - empty arrays returned on error
    ✅ User-friendly error messages in UI
    ✅ 401/403 errors for unauthorized access
    ✅ Console logging for debugging (noted as tech debt)

  testing_coverage: "GOOD"
  notes: |
    ✅ Dashboard query functions: 100% coverage
    ✅ Error cases and edge cases tested
    ✅ Empty result handling tested
    ✅ Percentage calculations verified
    ℹ️ Component tests minimal (acceptable for MVP)

  documentation: "EXCELLENT"
  notes: |
    ✅ Comprehensive Dev Notes in story file
    ✅ Code comments in dashboard.ts explaining query logic
    ✅ Critical visual acuity thresholds documented
    ✅ Database migration documented

# DATABASE REVIEW
# ==============================================================================

database:
  migration_005:
    status: "VERIFIED"
    file: "app/src/lib/server/db/migrations/005_add_gestor_role_to_avaliadores.sql"
    changes:
      - "Added is_gestor BOOLEAN column to pse.avaliadores (default: false)"
      - "Added column comment for documentation"
      - "Created partial index for performance (WHERE is_gestor = true)"
    notes: |
      ✅ Migration follows naming convention
      ✅ Uses IF NOT EXISTS for idempotency
      ✅ Includes helpful comment
      ✅ Index added for query optimization
      ✅ Non-breaking change (defaults to false)

  queries:
    status: "VERIFIED"
    performance: "GOOD"
    notes: |
      ✅ getAnthropometricStats: Efficient GROUP BY with COUNT aggregation
      ✅ getVisualAcuityStats: Uses CTE and UNION ALL for range bucketing
      ✅ getDentalRiskStats: Simple GROUP BY with percentage calculation
      ✅ getEvaluationCoverageStats: Two-query approach acceptable for MVP
      ✅ All queries filter by ano_referencia (year)
      ✅ Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection
      ℹ️ Future: Consider adding composite indexes for dashboard queries
