# Detailed findings
findings:
  strengths:
    - "All 16 database tables from shared and pse schemas properly typed with accurate nullable field marking"
    - "TypeScript interfaces accurately reflect PostgreSQL schema including GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY patterns"
    - "SSL configuration, connection pooling, and error handling appropriate for production deployment"
    - "Clean API surface with index.ts providing single import point for excellent developer experience"
    - "Migration directory structure prepared for future schema evolution"
    - "Healthcheck endpoint provides meaningful diagnostics with proper error handling and HTTP status codes"

  observations:
    - "Schema has comprehensive SQL COMMENT documentation that could enhance TypeScript interfaces (optional enhancement)"
    - "Numeric precision types mapped to TypeScript number - correct approach, runtime validation can be added in future CRUD operations"
    - "SQL client implemented as module-level singleton - appropriate pattern for SvelteKit serverless architecture"
