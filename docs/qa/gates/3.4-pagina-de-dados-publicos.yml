      EXCEPTIONAL security implementation:
      - Zero PII exposure risk - all queries return ONLY aggregated data
      - Parameterized SQL queries prevent injection attacks
      - Year parameter validation prevents malicious input
      - No authentication bypass vulnerabilities
      - Comprehensive security-focused unit tests verify NO PII in results
      - SQL queries audited: Only COUNT, GROUP BY - no individual records
      - Error handling does not leak sensitive information
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Efficient aggregation queries:
      - Reuses existing database indexes from manager dashboard
      - Parallel Promise.all() for multiple query execution
      - Graceful degradation on errors
      - No N+1 query issues
      - Efficient GROUP BY and COUNT operations
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Robust error handling:
      - All query functions have try-catch with fallback to empty arrays
      - Server load function returns safe defaults on error
      - TypeScript strict mode enabled (0 type errors)
      - Test suite: 262 tests passed
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Excellent code quality:
      - Clear security comments throughout codebase
      - Self-documenting interfaces with TypeScript
      - Reuses existing EChart component (DRY principle)
      - Consistent patterns from manager dashboard
      - Comprehensive JSDoc documentation

  future:
    - action: 'Consider adding rate limiting for public endpoint to prevent abuse'
      refs: ['app/src/routes/dados-publicos/+page.server.ts']
      priority: low
      rationale: 'Public pages can be targets for DoS. Future enhancement for production hardening.'

      refs: ['app/src/lib/server/db/queries/public-dashboard.ts']
      priority: low
      rationale: 'Mentioned in Dev Notes as performance consideration. Monitor in production.'

strengths:
  - Security-first approach with multiple layers of PII protection
  - Comprehensive test coverage focused on anonymization verification
  - Clean separation of public vs protected routes
  - Excellent reuse of existing components and patterns
  - Clear documentation and security comments
  - Proper TypeScript typing for type safety
  - SEO metadata for public discoverability
  - Accessibility-friendly public interface
  - Desktop-first responsive design implemented correctly

  SECURITY VERIFICATION PERFORMED:
  1. ✅ SQL Query Audit: All 4 query functions use COUNT/GROUP BY - NO individual records
  2. ✅ Interface Audit: TypeScript interfaces contain ONLY aggregated fields
  3. ✅ Test Audit: 15 security-focused tests verify PII absence
  4. ✅ Server Load Audit: No authentication checks, year validation present
  5. ✅ UI Audit: No links to individual pages, only aggregated visualizations
  6. ✅ Error Handling Audit: Graceful degradation without information leakage

  EXCEPTIONAL PRACTICES OBSERVED:
  - Multiple comments marking queries as "PUBLIC - Anonymized"
  - Dedicated test suite section "CRITICAL SECURITY TESTS - PII Exposure Prevention"
  - JSON.stringify() verification in tests to catch any serialized PII
  - Comprehensive JSDoc for each public function explaining anonymization
  - Year parameter validation prevents invalid input exploitation
