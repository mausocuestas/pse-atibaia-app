recommendations:
  immediate: []  # All critical issues resolved

  future:
    - action: 'Add integration tests with real database to catch schema mismatches early'
      rationale: 'Would have caught schema mismatch in initial implementation'
      implementation: 'Use Docker container with test PostgreSQL instance'
      refs:
        - 'app/src/lib/server/db/queries/matricula-import.test.ts'

    - action: 'Implement real-time progress updates to UI'
      rationale: 'Progress callback mechanism exists but not connected to UI'
      implementation: 'Use WebSockets or Server-Sent Events for real-time updates'
      refs:
        - 'app/src/lib/server/services/import-orchestrator.service.ts'

    - action: 'Add load testing with 1000+ record files'
      rationale: 'Validate performance under realistic production loads'
      implementation: 'Create test fixtures and performance benchmarks'
      refs: []

    - action: 'Create admin audit log for import operations'
      rationale: 'Track all imports with file hashes for duplicate detection'
      implementation: 'Add audit_log table and tracking logic'
