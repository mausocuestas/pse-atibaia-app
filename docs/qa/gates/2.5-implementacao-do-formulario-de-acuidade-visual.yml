# Quality Gate Decision: Story 2.5
# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect)

schema: 1
story: "2.5"
story_title: "Implementação do Formulário de Acuidade Visual"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "All acceptance criteria met with excellent test coverage, but critical database schema design deviation introduces data integrity risk. Implementation allows multiple evaluations per year instead of one, with 204 duplicate records in production."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"
updated: "2025-10-26T10:15:00Z"

top_issues:
  - id: "SCHEMA-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "Database schema deviation: Implementation allows multiple visual acuity evaluations per student per year, creating 204 duplicate (aluno_id, ano_referencia) records. Story design expected unique constraint, but saveVisualAcuityEvaluation() checks avaliado_em=CURRENT_DATE instead, allowing different-day evaluations."
    suggested_action: "Team must decide: (1) Keep multi-evaluation design and document in PRD/architecture, or (2) Revert to single-evaluation-per-year with migration to clean duplicates. Recommend decision before Story 2.6."
    suggested_owner: "po"

  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Test suite validates UPSERT behavior but doesn't test actual implementation (same-day update check with change detection). Test at line 338-389 mocks generic UPSERT, not the actual SELECT-then-UPDATE-if-changed logic."
    suggested_action: "Add test cases: (1) same-day no-change returns existing, (2) same-day with-change updates, (3) different-day creates new record. Update mock strategy to match implementation."
    suggested_owner: "dev"

  - id: "VALIDATION-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Client validates 0.0-1.0 range but server schema/validation allows 0.0-2.0. Mismatch between UI constraints (VisualAcuityForm max='1.0') and server schema (z.number().max(1.0))."
    suggested_action: "Clarify with PO: Is visual acuity range 0.0-1.0 or 0.0-2.0? Story Dev Notes mention 0.1-2.0 range but form enforces 1.0 max. Align all layers to same range."

  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Zod validation on all server inputs. Session auth checked. No SQL injection vectors (parameterized queries)."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Queries optimized with indexes on (aluno_id, ano_referencia). ORDER BY avaliado_em DESC ensures most recent fetched first. No N+1 issues."
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Data integrity risk from duplicate records. Error handling adequate (try-catch, null returns). Change detection prevents unnecessary updates."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean separation of concerns. Well-documented Dev Notes. Svelte 5 runes used correctly. TypeScript strict mode with explicit types."
