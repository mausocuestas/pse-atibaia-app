# Non-Functional Requirements Validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Proper session management via Auth.js, server-side route protection, no sensitive data exposure. Minor type safety concern with 'as any' casts is acceptable technical debt."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Minimal server load, efficient session reuse, no unnecessary data fetching. Test execution: 19ms (excellent)."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent error handling with optional chaining, proper redirects, all edge cases covered in tests. 13/13 tests passing."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean code organization, successful refactoring eliminated duplication, comprehensive documentation, proper TypeScript usage."
