story_title: "Filtragem e Geração de Relatórios"
gate: PASS
status_reason: "Excellent production-ready implementation with all ACs met, comprehensive security, strong code quality, and thorough post-implementation fixes. Minor deduction for incomplete manual testing (non-critical)."

# Non-functional requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - Multi-layer authentication/authorization (manager role verified in +page.server.ts and export API)
      - SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries
      - Input validation with Zod schemas
      - 401 for unauthenticated, 403 for non-managers
      - Export limited to 10K records (prevents resource exhaustion)

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - Parallel execution of data + count queries
      - LIMIT/OFFSET pagination (25 records/page)
      - Export capped at 10,000 records
      - Loading states for async operations
      - Efficient Svelte 5 reactivity with $state and $derived

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - Comprehensive try-catch error handling
      - Graceful degradation (returns empty arrays on error)
      - Post-implementation fixes for edge cases (NULL handling, SSR compatibility)
      - 7 iterative commits addressing discovered issues

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - Clear separation of concerns (queries, API, UI)
      - TypeScript strict mode with complete type coverage
      - Inline documentation and comments
      - Comprehensive dev notes in story file

# Detailed recommendations
recommendations:
  immediate: []

  future:
    - action: "Complete manual testing verification (XLSX export accuracy, responsive layout testing)"
      priority: medium
      refs: ["Story Task 8"]
      rationale: "Automated tests cover core logic, but manual verification ensures production readiness"

    - action: "Consider database indexing on frequently filtered columns"
      priority: low
      refs:
        - "pse.matriculas(escola_id, ano_letivo)"
        - "pse.avaliacoes_*(aluno_id, ano_referencia)"
      rationale: "Performance optimization for production scale (not currently a bottleneck)"

    - action: "Add integration tests with test database setup"
      priority: low
      refs: ["app/src/lib/server/db/queries/reports.test.ts"]
      rationale: "Current pragmatic approach (mocks + real DB testing) is acceptable, but formal integration tests would improve confidence"

# Implementation highlights
highlights:
  - "Well-structured query builder with dynamic filter conditions (reports.ts)"
  - "Dual-worksheet XLSX export with filter summary (excellent UX)"
  - "Dynamic period filtering based on school selection (enhancement beyond ACs)"
  - "Comprehensive post-implementation fixes (7 commits) addressing edge cases"
  - "Real-world validation via direct Neon database testing"
  - "Filter persistence via URL parameters (bookmarkable/shareable)"

    - Validation test correctly verifies Zod rejects invalid input
    - Error handling test confirms graceful degradation
    - Complex multi-table JOINs appropriately tested on real database
    - Mocking skipped where it would provide false confidence
    - Manual testing checklist defined but not fully completed
